/**
 * A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)

 * In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope
 * from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time
 * a function is created, at function creation time.

 * The following code illustrates how to use closures to define public
 * functions that can access private functions and variables. Using
