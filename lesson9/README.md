# Greetings

Today we are continuing our workshop (or if you just got back)

Main objectives today

## Setup

Pull your own project from last workshop or pull the existing one from `lesson8/movies-app`

## Todo list:

1. Refactor movies-app so it could use react-router
   1. Setup webpack for routing support
2. Add multi language support by using context api (the translationstrings could be created locally in a JSON file)
3. Make working favorites list (that could show our favorites movies)
   - Store the favorites list inside localstorage
