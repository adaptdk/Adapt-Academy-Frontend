# Greetings
Today we are going to create a small workshop for testing our skills on both React hooks and React states by making a small movie application using create react app

1. In this folder create react application `npx create-react-app APPLICATION-NAME`
2. Setup Sass `npm install node-sass` and update .scss files
3. Test if api is working, API key: `8731e0fb` Documentation: `http://www.omdbapi.com/`
4. Let's make the app together by creating:
   1. Initial components for app (header, search page)
   2. A Search page with results (image, title, years)
   3. An ability to favorite movie
   4. An ability to display movie desciprion (page of movie)
