*** EXERCISE BRIEF ***

You are a really cool HTML-CSS Guru right now. It's time to shine and deliver something nice on your own.

1. Pick any web design from the internet that you like. It has to contain different elements[components]. 
Good place to search for designs is dribble and google. If you need to do something personally, feel free to do that as well. As long as it's complex enough - it fits.
2. Make sure you use all the correct practices, modular approach, BEM and so on.
3. See if you can make reusable sass mixins, animations, functions or whatever else that you might need.
4. May the force be with you!
