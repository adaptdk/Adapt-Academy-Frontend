          <h3>I was studying :</h3>
          <p>Strangely enough in 2009 I graduated as an artist.
            So I've done lots of crazy stuff like glassblowing,
            participating in performances (of course drawing, painting
            and composition was part of the curriculum).

      <p>
        I always liked pretty stuff
        and technology so web development,
        kind of fell into my lap. I'm driven
        by learning new stuff, and aspiring
        to be a full stack web developer
        someday. At the moment I'm
        doing my best to crack the basics
        and I'm focusing on the front-end.
